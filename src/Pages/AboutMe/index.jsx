      <h1>Hello! I'm Eduardo Ara√∫jo</h1>
      <br />
      <p> My passions: technology, full stack development, Games</p>
      
      <p> From a very young age, I have always been fascinated by online games. The thrill of exploring virtual worlds and interacting with other people sparked a deep interest in understanding how these technological wonders were created. That's how I discovered my passion for programming.</p>

      <p> About six months ago, I decided to venture into the coding universe. With dedication and enthusiasm, I immersed myself in programming languages and started learning the fundamental concepts of this field. I discovered that I had a natural talent for the art of programming and became even more motivated to improve my skills.</p>


      <p> Currently, I am enrolled in the Information Systems course at UFU, where I have the opportunity to expand my theoretical and practical knowledge. Through the course, I can dive even deeper into system development and deepen my understanding of the technology that drives the world.</p>

      <p> However, what truly sets me apart is my vision of becoming a full stack developer. I believe that mastering both front-end and back-end development is essential for my professional and personal growth. I want to have the ability to create comprehensive technological solutions, from user interface design to database management and business logic implementation.</p>

      <p> I am constantly seeking new opportunities to enhance my skills as a full stack developer. Whether through personal projects, online courses, or participation in programming communities, I am determined to become a versatile and highly qualified professional in this field.</p>

      <p> Technology is my world, and I am excited about all the possibilities it offers. I can't wait to embark on this exciting journey as a full stack developer and make my contribution to technological advancement.</p>

      <p> That's my story so far, and I'm eager to see what the future holds for me in this incredible field of technology and development.</p>
